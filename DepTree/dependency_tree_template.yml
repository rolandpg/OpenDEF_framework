hunting_id: 
    source: "datasource" # example data source
    index: "index or view" # index or view 
    fields: ["list", "of","fields"] # fields that are used for the hunt/detection
    enrich_field: ["domain"] # the idea of having enrich field is to identify opportunities for creating cache table
    query: "the query itself" # the query itself 

# Having a dependency tree will provide opportunities for: 
# 1) Unifying hunts/detections into one
# 2) Creating a dependency which will be communicated to engineering and prevent failures in case of future changes to the data
# 3) Clearly understand the impact of data change
